# Getting Things Done

A good(?) summary video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnnaJkKdwjU

- **"Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them."**
    - Have a system for remembering other than your brain. Doesn't matter *what* as much as it matters that you trust it, you use it, and it is fast & easy.
    - You don't have to worry about forgetting things.
    - You can focus on the one task at hand without being distracted by everything else.
- **Have an "inbox" where you can throw all your ideas, immediately, when you have them.**
    - I find paper often works best for this, as switching apps tends to be too slow & distracting.
    - You may have multiple inboxes (i.e. paper, digital, etc.)
    - Email is just an inbox, not a to-do list.
    - Don't organize yet, that's distracting.
- **Regularly go through the inbox to put things in their right place:**
    - if you can completely take care of it in 2 minutes, just do it
    - some stuff is trash
    - some stuff you wait for others for or need to be reminded laterâ€”calendar alert or similar
    - some stuff just needs to be filed for reference
    - otherwise, pick the next actionable thing you can do, put it on your to-do list, and file it away
- **Regularly go through the to-do list, and:**
    - remove stuff that doesn't matter
    - prioritize what needs to be done next
    - some things get delegated to a "someday, maybe" list: good ideas, just not now
- **Do stuff!**
    - some tasks require a certain location or tools; do them when you are there
    - do small tasks when have small time slot, larger tasks when larger
    - do hard tasks when you have lots of energy, easy tasks when you don't
    - prioritize by importance
